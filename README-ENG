**🎯General Objective**

Develop a predictive model to identify customers with a high probability of canceling their membership in the upcoming month and create a data-driven retention strategy.

🧩Methodology Used

 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
 - Predictive Modeling (Supervised Learning)
 - Customer Segmentation (Unsupervised Learning)

☘️Expected Results

 - A machine learning model with acceptable performance (e.g., AUC > 0.75) capable of predicting which customers are at high risk of canceling.
 - Identification of 3 to 5 distinct customer segments or clusters.
 - Discovery that at least 1 or 2 clusters have a significantly higher churn rate than the average.
 - A set of key factors (e.g., low visit frequency, expiring contract) that directly impact the decision to cancel.
 - A list of specific recommendations and marketing actions to retain customers in each risk segment.
