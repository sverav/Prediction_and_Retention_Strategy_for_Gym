# Customer Churn Prediction and Retention Strategy for Model Fitness Gym Chain

This project involves developing a comprehensive customer churn prediction system and retention strategy for Model Fitness gym chain using machine learning and clustering techniques. The goal is to identify at-risk customers, understand behavioral patterns, and create targeted retention campaigns to reduce customer attrition.
**Business Context**
Industry Challenge: Customer churn is a critical issue for fitness centers, where customers often leave without explicit cancellation notices
Company: Model Fitness gym chain implementing data-driven customer interaction strategies
Key Problem: Identifying customers who have "quietly left" without formal account cancellation or contract non-renewal
Business Definition: A customer is considered churned if they don't visit the gym for one month

**Project Objectives**
Predictive Modeling: Build machine learning models to predict churn probability for the next month
Customer Segmentation: Create user personas by identifying distinct customer groups and their characteristics
Factor Analysis: Determine which factors most significantly impact customer churn
Strategic Recommendations: Develop actionable retention strategies and customer service improvements

**Data Structure & Features**
Customer Demographics
Gender: Customer gender classification
Age: Customer age information
Near_Location: Whether customer lives/works near the gym location
Partner: Employment at partner companies (corporate discount eligibility)
Phone: Contact information availability

Engagement & History
Lifetime: Duration of gym membership (in months)
Promo_friends: Whether customer joined through "bring a friend" referral program
Contract_period: Membership duration (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year)
Month_to_end_contract: Remaining months until contract expiration

Usage Patterns
Group_visits: Participation in group fitness sessions
Avg_class_frequency_total: Average weekly visit frequency over customer lifetime
Avg_class_frequency_current_month: Average weekly visits in current month
Avg_additional_charges_total: Total spending on additional services (caf√©, sports products, cosmetics, massages)

Target Variable
Churn: Binary indicator of customer cancellation for the analyzed month

**Analytical Methodology**
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data Quality Assessment: Identify missing values and data completeness
Statistical Summary: Calculate means, standard deviations, and distributions using describe() method
Comparative Analysis: Compare feature means between churned and retained customers using groupby()
Visual Analysis: Create histograms and distribution plots for churned vs. retained customer segments
Correlation Analysis: Generate and visualize correlation matrix to identify feature relationships

2. Machine Learning Model Development
Objective: Binary classification to predict next-month churn probability
Model Training Process

Data Splitting: Use train_test_split() to create training and validation datasets
Algorithm Comparison: Train and evaluate two models:

Logistic Regression: Linear probability model for interpretable results
Random Forest: Ensemble method for capturing complex feature interactions

Model Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: Overall prediction correctness
Precision: True positive rate among predicted positives
Recall: True positive rate among actual positives
Model Selection: Compare performance metrics to determine optimal approach

3. Customer Segmentation Analysis
Objective: Identify distinct customer groups for targeted retention strategies
Clustering Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Standardize features for clustering analysis
Hierarchical Clustering: Use linkage() function to create distance matrix and generate dendrograms
Optimal Cluster Selection: Analyze dendrogram to determine appropriate number of customer segments
K-Means Clustering: Apply K-means algorithm with n=5 clusters for customer segmentation
Cluster Profiling: Analyze mean feature values and distributions for each customer segment

**Cluster Analysis**
Behavioral Patterns: Identify distinguishing characteristics of each customer group
Churn Rate Analysis: Calculate and compare churn rates across different customer segments using groupby()
Risk Assessment: Classify clusters as high-risk (churn-prone) vs. loyal customer groups

**Expected Deliverables**
1. Predictive Model Performance Report

Model Comparison: Detailed evaluation of logistic regression vs. random forest performance
Feature Importance: Identification of key factors driving customer churn
Prediction Accuracy: Quantified model performance for business decision-making

2. Customer Segmentation Profiles

Segment Characteristics: Detailed profiles of 5 distinct customer groups
Behavioral Insights: Usage patterns, demographics, and engagement levels for each segment
Churn Risk Assessment: Risk classification and retention priority for each customer group

3. Strategic Recommendations
Target Group Identification: High-value segments requiring focused retention efforts
Retention Measures: Specific tactics to reduce churn in each customer segment
Customer Interaction Patterns: Insights into optimal engagement strategies
Business Impact & Applications

**Operational Benefits**
Proactive Retention: Early identification of at-risk customers enables preventive interventions
Resource Optimization: Targeted marketing efforts based on customer segment characteristics
Revenue Protection: Reduced churn rates directly impact gym membership revenue

**Strategic Advantages**
